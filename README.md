# Hybrid-model-to-predict-ICC-activity-from-efferent-cholinergic-neuron-stimulation
This code belongs to a hybrid model which is mechanistic model (michaelis menten equation using hill coefficient) and a Multilayer Perceptron to predict Interstitial Cells of Cajal (ICC) activity (frequency and amplitude) from efferent cholinergic neuron pathway stimulation. The hybrid model is an example of a Physics Informed Neural Network as it has mechanistic and AI components.

This script generates a simulated dataset of ICC frequency (cpm) and amplitude in the antrum, using mechanistic curves for acetylcholine (ACh) release and its excitatory modulation on ICC activity. Animal-to-animal variability is introduced, and Gaussian noise is added to mimic experimental measurements. The simulation spans multiple animals and is informed by values reported in experimental studies, producing both individual and mean ICC responses across efferent input levels.
